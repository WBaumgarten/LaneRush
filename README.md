# LaneRush
A simple 2 player strategy game of managing resources, spawning troops and destroying the enemy castle

Currently the game does not have any menus and still requires some sprites and art as well as balancing.

## How to play
Spawn units in a specific lane that will automatically move and attack. When they reach the enemy castle wall they will start to attack the castle.
Each unit has different costs, attack range, movement speed and damage.
You can also spawn miners and lumberjacks which will increase gold and timber production in the long run.
